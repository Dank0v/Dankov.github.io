# Analog Design and Optimization Projects

This repository hosts my personal website, where I document projects and explorations in **analog circuit design**, **optimization techniques**, and related areas.

The site is live here: [View Website](https://dank0v.github.io/Dankov.github.io/)

## About the Site
The site is organized around three main areas:
- **Analog Design** — circuits, simulations, and hands-on experiments.  
- **Optimization in Analog Design** — algorithms, workflows, and techniques for performance improvement.  
- **Miscellaneous Work** — side projects, technical notes, and other explorations.

## Tech Stack
The site is built using:
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive and documented experiments

## AI?
Yes the site is written with AI, as well as this markdown. No I will not learn how to write HTML.
